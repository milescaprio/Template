My template for all Python projects. Simple notebook and library setup.
Use if you'd like!

**utils.py**: math functions I commonly use
**main.py**: main file
**src_template.py**: template for a module
**notebook_template.py**: Template for a notebook that relies on project source code.
**recyc.py**: Place to paste old uncommited code you don't have to heart to delete
